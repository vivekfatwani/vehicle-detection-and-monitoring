## 📌 Overview  
The **Vehicle Detection and Monitoring System** is a computer vision project designed to detect, classify, and track vehicles in real-time from traffic footage.  

The system leverages deep learning and tracking algorithms to:  
- Detect cars and other vehicles on the road.  
- Assign unique IDs to each detected vehicle.  
- Track vehicle movement across frames.  
- Visualize trajectories with bounding boxes and tracking lines.  

This project can serve as a base for:  
- 🚦 **Traffic flow analysis**  
- 📊 **Vehicle counting & density estimation**  
- 🛣️ **Smart transportation systems**  
- 🚔 **Law enforcement (speed detection, violations)**  

---

## ✨ Features  
✅ Real-time vehicle detection  
✅ Vehicle tracking with unique IDs  
✅ Bounding box visualization  
✅ Trajectory mapping  
✅ Extendable for speed and license plate recognition

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language:** Python 🐍  
- **Frameworks & Libraries:**  
  - OpenCV  
  - NumPy  
  - Matplotlib (for visualization)  
  - TensorFlow / PyTorch (for detection models)  
  - SORT / DeepSORT (for tracking)  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/vivekfatwani/vehicle-detection-and-monitoring.git](https://github.com/vivekfatwani/vehicle-detection-and-monitoring.git)
    cd vehicle-detection-and-monitoring
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended)
    ```bash
    # Create the virtual environment
    python -m venv venv
    
    # Activate on Mac/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    
    # Activate on Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Run the notebook**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook vehicle_detection_and_monitoring.ipynb
    ```

---

## 🚀 Usage

1.  Upload a traffic video (CCTV, dashcam, or highway footage).
2.  Run the notebook cell by cell.
3.  The system will:
    * Detect vehicles
    * Assign IDs
    * Track their trajectories
    * Display results inline

---

## 📈 Future Improvements

-   🔹 Vehicle speed estimation
-   🔹 Integration with live CCTV feeds
-   🔹 License plate recognition (ANPR)
-   🔹 Dashboard for real-time traffic analytics
-   🔹 Support for multiple vehicle classes (bus, truck, bike, etc.)

## 🧾 Requirements

Basic dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. Key libraries include:

* `numpy`
* `opencv-python`
* `matplotlib`
* `tensorflow` # or `torch` (depending on the detection model used)

👉 You can extend this with extra libraries (e.g., DeepSORT, scikit-learn) as needed.
